# AMDproject
Project for the course "Algorithms for Massive Datasets" of University of Milano of the 2021/2022 academic year

The repository includes:
- The notebook that contains all the code written with a direct link to open it in google colab
- The report of the project with detailed explanation of all the steps

Everything was done by myself and wherever I used an external library or resources I explicitly wrote it and linked it.
