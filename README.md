# Algorithms for Massive Datasets project
Project for the course "Algorithms for Massive Datasets" of University of Milano of the 2021/2022 academic year

I choose the project 1 from the ones proposed by the professor which has the following outline:

 > Finding similar items -  The task is to implement from scratch a detector of pairs of similar tweets, considering the text column of the dataset and selecting tweets written in a given language.


The repository includes:
- The notebook that contains all the code written with a direct link to open it in google colab
- The report of the project with detailed explanation of all the steps

Everything was done by myself and wherever I used an external library or resources I explicitly wrote it and linked it.
